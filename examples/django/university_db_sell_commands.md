# Various database operations using the Django database shell.

### 1. Deleting Model:

To delete a model, you can use the `dbshell` to execute SQL commands. First, let's say you want to delete the `Student` model:

```bash
python manage.py dbshell
```

Inside the database shell, you can run SQL commands:

```sql
DROP TABLE college_student;
```

Make sure to adjust the table name according to your Django app and model names.

### 2. Basic Data Access:

You can access data using the Django ORM directly in the Python shell:

```bash
python manage.py shell
```

```python
# Import your models
from college.models import College, Course, Subject, Student

# Access all colleges
colleges = College.objects.all()

# Access a specific college
my_college = College.objects.get(name='My College')

# Access all students related to a college
students = my_college.students.all()

# Access all courses related to a college
courses = my_college.courses.all()
```

### 3. Inserting Data:

You can create and save instances of your models to insert data:

```python
# Create a new college
new_college = College(name='New College', location='New Location')
new_college.save()

# Create a new course and associate it with a college
new_course = Course(name='New Course', duration_years=4, college=new_college)
new_course.save()

# Create a new student and associate it with a college and courses
new_student = Student(first_name='John', last_name='Doe', age=22, college=new_college)
new_student.save()
new_student.courses.add(new_course)
```

### 4. Updating Data:

You can update existing data using the Django ORM:

```python
# Update the name of a college
my_college.name = 'Updated College'
my_college.save()

# Update the name of a course
new_course.name = 'Updated Course'
new_course.save()
```

### 5. Selecting Objects:

```python
# Select all students
all_students = Student.objects.all()

# Select students with a specific age
young_students = Student.objects.filter(age__lt=25)

# Select students with a specific first name
johns = Student.objects.filter(first_name='John')
```

### 6. Filtering Data:

```python
# Filter courses with a duration greater than 3 years
long_courses = Course.objects.filter(duration_years__gt=3)

# Filter subjects related to a specific course
course_subjects = Subject.objects.filter(course=new_course)
```

### 7. Retrieving Single Object:

```python
# Retrieve a single student by ID
student_by_id = Student.objects.get(id=1)

# Retrieve a single college by name
college_by_name = College.objects.get(name='Updated College')
```

### 8. Data Ordering:

```python
# Order students by age in descending order
ordered_students = Student.objects.order_by('-age')

# Order colleges by name in ascending order
ordered_colleges = College.objects.order_by('name')
```

### 9. Slicing Data:

```python
# Get the first three students
first_three_students = Student.objects.all()[:3]
```

### 10. Deleting Objects:

```python
# Delete a specific student
student_to_delete = Student.objects.get(id=1)
student_to_delete.delete()

# Delete all students
Student.objects.all().delete()
```

### 11. Making Changes in Database Schema:

If you need to make changes to your database schema (e.g., adding or removing fields), you can use migrations. 

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 12. Adding and Removing Fields:

If you want to add or remove fields from your models:

- Add a new field to your model class.
- Create a migration using `makemigrations`.
- Apply the migration using `migrate`.

### 13. Removing Models:

If you need to remove a model:

- Comment out or remove the model class from `models.py`.
- Create a migration using `makemigrations`.
- Apply the migration using `migrate`.
